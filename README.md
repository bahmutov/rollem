# Deprecated

**Rollup 0.42+ supports multiple configs per file exactly like `rollem`.**

## Why?

[Rollup](http://rollupjs.org/) is great, but
[does not handle multiple bundles](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/703)
right out of the box. **Rollem** just handles a simple case

```js
// rollem.config.js
module.exports = [{
  entry: 'src/foo.js',
  dest: 'dist/foo.js'
}, {
  entry: 'src/bar.js',
  dest: 'dist/bar.js'
}]
```

Which builds two bundles `dist/foo.js` and `dist/bar.js` when you run
`rollem`.

## Install and use

```text
npm install -D rollem
// create rollem.config.js shown above
// then set script command
"build": "rollem"
```

You can pass `--watch` option in the command to enable simple bundle rebuild
on changes.

You can pass `-c <filename>` to specify a different config file.

## rollem.config.js

Almost the same syntax as [rollup.config.js](http://rollupjs.org/guide/#using-config-files)
but exports an Array. You can use JavaScript module to create the list of configs dynamically.

```js
// rollem.config.js with ES5
const configs = glob.sync('src/**/*-spec.js').map(toConfig)
module.exports = configs
```

```js
// rollem.config.js with ES6
export default [{
  entry: 'src/foo.js',
  dest: 'dist/foo.js'
}, {
  entry: 'src/child-folder/bar.js',
  dest: 'dist/bar.js',
  format: 'umd',
  moduleName: 'bar',
  sourceMap: 'inline'
}]
```

## API

In addition to the simple command line, you can use **rollem** via its
module API. It exports a single function

```js
const rollem = require('rollem')
rollem(configs, options)
```

* `configs` - simple Array of Rollup config objects
* `options` - object with options, right now only `watch` property is
  supported.

The `rollem(configs, options)` returns a Promise, resolved after the
bundles have been built. The promise is resolved with the list of built files.

If you run `rollem(configs, {watch: true})` then the resolved Promise will
give you an event emitter. Every time there is a file change, you first
will get "changed" event, and after the bundles have been built you will
get an event "rolled".

```js
rollem(configs, {watch: true})
  .then((ee) => {
    ee.on('changed', () => console.log('bundles will be rebuilt'))
    ee.on('rolled', () => console.log('new bundles have been built'))
  })
```

The **rollem** in watch mode tries to determine the folder to watch from the source files.
Because it only knows about the top level entry file, it just grabs and watches
the top parent folders. For example, if entries specify `src/entry.js, src/foo/bar.js` then
the top parent folder watched will be `src`.

## Debug

If something is wrong, run the tool with debug output enabled

```sh
DEBUG=rollem rollem
```
